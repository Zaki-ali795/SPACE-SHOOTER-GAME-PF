# Space Shooter 2D Game
# Description about Project
This Space Shooter Game is a normal copy of original Space Shooter in which  our SpaceShip and Enemies are represented by rectangles.<br>
Its a beginner level project which I had completed with my college partner so it may have some incompetencies but it works fine.<br>
Its uses SFML and C++ with concepts of OOP.
